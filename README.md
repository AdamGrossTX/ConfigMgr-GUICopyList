# ConfigMgr-GUICopyList

At MMSMOA I asked David James about adding the ability to copy text from the device properties box. He suggested that I start a list of places in the SCCM/ConfigMgr console where copying the text is unavailable, but would be helpful.

Gary Blok started a UserVoice with some great ideas for adding additional text that can be copied from the console as well:

If you find somewhere in the console that would benefit from copying the text, but currently doesn't work, please update the list and provide as much detail as possible.
